Aeon-ZTPS
=========

Aeon-ZTPS is a universal Zero-Touch-Provisioning server for data center infrastructure systems.
Aeon-ZTPS was developed specifically to address the need for network engineers to bootstrap their data center
switches without having to deal with the differences in the underlying NOS mechanisms.

Aeon-ZTPS runs as an Ubuntu 16.04LTS server using the Flask framework and a simple SQLite database.
Aeon-ZTPS provides both a REST/JSON API and a GUI.
Aeon-ZTPS can optionally provide the DHCP service (included, but not enabled by default).
